Goal: NativeAOT AOT compiler (ILC)

Advantages of using native vs managed
 - Benefits of NativeAOT - fast startup, no need to JIT, smaller WS
 - Issues related to .NET conflicts (ILC relies on managed runtime to work but deals with assets that are somewhat different, for example, reduced .NET runtime, that has diferent runtime and librarries)
 - Dogfood nativeAOT early

Existing Behavior (Prior to this change)
 - ILC is managed as packaged 
    + e.g. runtime.win-x64.microsoft.dotnet.ilcompiler\7.0.0-rc.1.22403.8\tools\ILCompiler.Compiler.dll
        # c:\Users\lakshanf\.nuget\packages\runtime.win-x64.microsoft.dotnet.ilcompiler\7.0.0-rc.1.22403.8\tools\

Options
1) [Preferred] Bootstrap
    a) Existing runtime is used to create managed ILC
    b) Use the new ILC, and other related NativeAOT assets to nativeAOT ILC
    c) Point to the AOT ILC location for all future references, including where the pkg is getting to be used

Pre-Reqs (understand first)
 - Packages: How are they build
    + How is each OfficialBuildRID supported, specifically for aot ilc (linux arm64?)
 - CrossGen: Uses AOT ILC

Investigation - Packages
[Build]
 - CoreCLRILCompilerDir (15) = c:\work\core\CurrentWork\runtime\artifacts\bin\coreclr\windows.x64.Debug\ilc-published\
    + Mostly pdb files
 - LibrariesRuntimeFiles (500): c:\work\core\CurrentWork\runtime\artifacts\bin\microsoft.netcore.app.runtime.win-x64\Debug\runtimes\win-x64\lib\net7.0\
 - CoreCLRAotSdkDir (38) = c:\work\core\CurrentWork\runtime\artifacts\bin\coreclr\windows.x64.Debug\aotsdk\
    + System.Private*.dll, pdb, runtime (GC, Globalization native, compression native, bootstrapper)
 - MibcOptimizationDataDir (4) = c:\work\core\CurrentWork\runtime\artifacts\mibc\
    + performance data? HW, TechEmpower etc
    + c:\work\core\CurrentWork\runtime\artifacts\mibc\windows\x64\data
 - CoreCLRBuildIntegrationDir = c:\work\core\CurrentWork\runtime\artifacts\bin\coreclr\windows.x64.Debug\build\
    + Has build assets including sdk.props (sets the SDK paths if first loaded))
 - Message: Microsoft.DotNet.ILCompiler -> c:\work\core\CurrentWork\runtime\artifacts\packages\Debug\Shipping\Microsoft.DotNet.ILCompiler.7.0.0-dev.nupkg
    + Contains the build package

[Runtime]
 - c:\work\core\CurrentWork\runtime\artifacts\packages\Debug\Shipping\runtime.win-x64.Microsoft.DotNet.ILCompiler.7.0.0-dev.nupkg

Task "CreateTrimDependencyGroups" skipped, due to false condition; ('@(FilePackageDependency)' != '' AND '$(PackageTargetRuntime)' == '') was evaluated as ('' != '' AND '' == '').
